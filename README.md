üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Summary
The GitHub Actions workflow executes the following steps automatically on every push and pull request to the main branch:

Setup & Dependencies: Checks out the code and installs Python 3.10, along with required packages from requirements.txt.

Linting: Runs flake8 to enforce code style and catch simple errors.

Testing: Runs pytest to execute all unit and integration tests.

Security Scanning (Bandit): Executes bandit to identify common security issues (e.g., use of assert, hardcoded passwords, unsafe imports) in Python code.

Static Code Analysis (CodeQL): Performs deep security and bug hunting analysis, with results uploaded directly to the GitHub repository's "Security" tab.

 How to Clone the Repository
You need the repository URL from GitHub (which typically ends in .git).

Find the URL: Go to your repository on GitHub, click the < > Code button, and copy the HTTPS URL.

Use the command line: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing the placeholder with your copied URL:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
Navigate to the project:

Bash

cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
2. Required Project Files (Checklist)
For the GitHub Actions pipeline to run without errors, these files are mandatory in your project structure:

File/Directory	Purpose
app.py	Your main Flask application file.
requirements.txt	CRITICAL: Lists all dependencies (flask, pytest, flake8, bandit, etc.) so the pipeline can install them.
tests/ (Directory)	Directory containing your tests.
tests/__init__.py	CRITICAL: An empty file that makes the tests directory a Python package, resolving the ModuleNotFoundError during testing.
tests/test_app.py	Your unit test file that imports and tests app.py.
.github/workflows/python-ci.yml	The actual workflow file that defines the CI/CD steps (lint, test, sca

Ensure you have a requirements.txt file and tests defined in your project.

Replace YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY in the README.md above with your actual repository path.

Push to the main branch, and the pipeline will automatically trigger.
