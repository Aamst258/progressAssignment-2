üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Summary
The GitHub Actions workflow executes the following steps automatically on every push and pull request to the main branch:

Setup & Dependencies: Checks out the code and installs Python 3.10, along with required packages from requirements.txt.

Linting: Runs flake8 to enforce code style and catch simple errors.

Testing: Runs pytest to execute all unit and integration tests.

Security Scanning (Bandit): Executes bandit to identify common security issues (e.g., use of assert, hardcoded passwords, unsafe imports) in Python code.

Static Code Analysis (CodeQL): Performs deep security and bug hunting analysis, with results uploaded directly to the GitHub repository's "Security" tab.
